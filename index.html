<c>Embodied Cycles</c>
<p>Embodied Cycles is a fertility awareness education practice founded by Kelly Brichta, a Justisse Holistic Reproductive Health Practitioner (HRHP) Intern and Fertility Awareness Educator (FAE) in training. It is based in Boulder, Colorado and offers in person programs and workshops at the Boulder Healing Hub.
<br>
<br>
Embodied Cycles’ mission is to provide benchmark fertility awareness education, teaching the Justisse Method to clients seeking to use fertility awareness to achieve pregnancy, avoid pregnancy and/or as an insight into their reproductive health across different stages in life. As an advocate of Fertility Awareness Based Methods (FABMs) and an Associate member of the <a class="intextlinks" target="_blank" href="https://www.factsaboutfertility.org/">Fertility Appreciation Collaborative to Teach the Science (FACTS)</a>, Kelly Brichta works towards a vision to increase knowledge of all FABMs through education, accessibility and collaboration.
</p>
    
<c>Fertility Awareness</c>
<p>Fertility awareness is a general term used to reference a variety of Fertility Awareness Based Methods (FABMs). These involve the tracking of primary fertility signs to determine the fertile and infertile phases of the menstrual cycle to achieve pregnancy or avoid pregnancy. Tracking the menstrual cycle is also used to monitor reproductive health. Six main categories of FABMs include Sympto-Thermal Methods, Cervical Mucus Only Methods, Basal Body Temperature Only Methods, Sympto-Hormonal Methods, Lactational Amenorrhea Methods, and Calendar Methods.</p>
    
<c>The Justisse Method</c>
<p>The Justisse Method is a Sympto-Thermal Method of fertility awareness that tracks the primary fertility signs of basal body temperature and cervical mucus (description and sensation), and occasionally cervical position. It is one of the most thorough, secular FABMs and integrates a holistic reproductive health perspective. The Justisse Method is committed to a non judgemental approach, serving and respecting all individuals and their reproductive health decisions.

<div id="faq" class="titles">
               <h1><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h1>
<c>What is the difference between the Justisse Method compared to other FABMs?</c>
<p>As a Sympto-Thermal Method, Justisse is already one of the most thorough methods of fertility awareness due to the observation of primary and accessible biomarkers of the body. However, one of its distinguishing aspects is the detail and standardization of mucus observations and sensations. This standardization is beneficial to better identify fertile days as well as track reproductive health. Other benefits include the Justisse Method’s holistic and secular approach to education.</p>
    
<c>I have read all the books on fertility awareness I could find and have been tracking my cycle for awhile now, but I never consulted a Fertility Awareness Educator, should I? What is the benefit?</c>
<p>Learning fertility awareness can feel confusing and frustrating, and cycles can change month to month. There is also a lot of information on the internet and in books that can be hard to parse through. Depending on the method you learned and practice, there could also be more to learn as there are nuanced differences between FABMs. No matter the reasons you are tracking, working with a Fertility Awareness Educator can help you reach a point where you feel confident using the method correctly and effectively.</p>
  
<c>Tracking my cycle seems hard and like a lot of work, is it? Does it take a long time to learn?</c>
<p>Like many FABMs, the Justisse Method involves initial time and dedication to learn, usually at least three months for the basics. However, once it is part of your routine, it becomes second nature. Deeper understandings of the body also develop the longer you track.</p>
    
<c>Why is it important to track my menstrual cycle in regards to health?</c>
<p>Menstrual cycle health is a reflection of overall health, so if you are the type of person that finds value in managing your health, tracking your cycle can give you a lot of information. Whether you are trying to achieve pregnancy and/or fertility or not, you can begin to understand, identify and manage the impacts of stress, premenstrual symptoms (PMS) and other reproductive health issues such dysmenorrhea, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, uterine fibroids, etc. in relation.</p>
    
<c>What if I am on the pill? Have an IUD? Transitioning hormone therapy? Can I still learn fertility awareness?</c>
<p>You can still learn fertility awareness if you are on the pill, have an IUD, or take hormone therapy. However, learning by tracking the menstrual cycle is most useful when you are not taking hormonal contraception or other endocrine disruptors. Some people track their cycles while on the copper IUD because it is non-hormonal. It may be also be beneficial to learn about your cycle before or after taking transitioning hormone therapy.</p>

    I have successfully used fertility awareness to avoid pregnancy and monitor my health coming off hormonal contraception as well as during lifestyle changes in light of reproductive, thyroid and other health concerns. My experience learning fertility awareness informed me that quality, inclusive education was hard to find. I hope to help change that.
